I have now started my first web app built with Ruby and the Sinatra Framework and it has been a lot of fun. My app is called Poppy, a place where people can leave reviews for movies and see the reviews that others leave. 

My initial idea was to create an app where people can write reviews, comment on reviews, and also make friends and movie dates with those friends. However, I have a lot to learn before I can set up relationships between users and implement those functionalities. I learned a lot doing this project and I enjoyed it.
